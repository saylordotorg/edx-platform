<p>${_("The Saylor Academy upholds high standards of academic integrity and will not
tolerate acts of dishonesty, falsification, misrepresentation, or collusion, including
instances of cheating, plagiarism, forgery, receiving external assistance on an
assignment or exam (except where authorized), completing an assignment or exam for
another, disseminating or sharing exam questions and answers, tampering with the
academic work of another, and facilitating another individual’s acts of intellectual
dishonesty.")}</p>
<p>${_("Plagiarism is a particularly pervasive problem in today’s digital age. Many do not
understand what plagiarism is and/or do not grasp the severity of its offense. The
Saylor Foundation defines plagiarism as the act of copying words or ideas from a
source without appropriate attribution; failing to put a quotation in quotation marks;
falsifying or withholding information about the source of a quotation; and/or turning in
the work of another as one’s own. We encourage you to think seriously about the way
in which you are interacting with and using the content you find on the Internet.")}</p>
